# Common-Sorting-Algorithms
Heap, Quick, Bubble... sorts functions in C, JS, Python and even Lua (why not ?)

## Overview
*Have you ever dreamt to have many of the sorting algorythms on ONE file ? (if you do, you make very strange dreams), I realized this dream.* \
there are in those files 6 sorting algorithms and 2 searching others. There are many utilitary, not to be used (you can if you want) utilitary functions too. their names begin with ```u_```. The function has the same use on each language, excepting in C, where every function need to have the size of the array as an adding argument.
## Which are these functions ?
### The searching ones:
```binarySearch(array, [size], target)``` : to search the index of the target in a SORTED array \
```linearSearch(array, [size], target)``` : to search the index of the target in every array \
### The sorting ones:
```bubbleSort(array, [size])``` <br>
```selectionSort(array, [...])``` <br>
```insertionSort(array)``` <br>
```quickSort(arr)``` <br>
```mergeSort(arr)``` <br>
```heapSort(arr)``` <br>
